  ## Installation
  Requires that https://nodejs.org/en be installed to properly be able to run the JavaScript locally. You can clone the repository to your local machine, or copy the files directly from the repository.

  ## Usage
  This app requires the Node JS RTE installed. To use the app using your command line navigate to the directory that has the index.js file downloaded from the repository. Once there, type the command node index.js to run the JavaScript. The command line will prompt you with several questions that when answered, will be converted to Markdown and stored in the README.md file inside of the develop folder.
